                                <p>
                                    Two sites near Paso Robles farm conscientiously, and both make excellent wines. But in the climate change era, one gets enough rain, the other doesn’t. Templeton, California — This is a story of two wine producers in the Paso Robles region. They are different in size, background and intent, yet they have important elements in common, starting with a commitment to the land and to creating diverse, sustainable ecosystems. One is thriving, the other struggling to survive.

                                <p>
                                    California cabernet sauvignon occupies a paradoxical position in the United States. It’s the country’s signature wine, yet it holds little interest among important groups of wine drinkers. Younger people in particular seem to ignore it.

                                    One of wine's greatest pleasures is its ability to enhance the dining experience, to join its solid counterpart at the table and to transform a meal from simple nourishment to sensual pleasure.

                                    Every summer heralds a signature wine, just as it heralds a signature song; certain wines have a way of ruling a restaurant or wine shop or even a whole city for those few months.

                                <p>
                                    The color of a wine can convey a lot about its character. But color is easy to misinterpret, and sometimes reveals less than it seems.

                                    The 2005 Bordeaux vintage will require decades to evolve and develop. Is that better than wines that are terrific sooner, but not as majestic?
